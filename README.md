# ATF Baseline Tests
Orlando-based scoped application for Servicenow Automated Test Framework (ATF) Baseline/OOB Tests

## Servicenow Release Compatibilities
:white_check_mark: [Orlando](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-release-notes/page/release-notes/family-release-notes.html)

## Servicenow plugin dependencies
None. These tests will work on a brand new instance and the core tables.

### Goal of this application
This is a [scoped app](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/c_ApplicationScope.html) in ServiceNow to give administrators and developers a faster Automated Testing implementation for a given feature set.

The goal of this application is to have a generic set of baseline tests, for a given product. These tests are generic and should work in any instance.
